	The USING clause is a shorthand that allows you to take advantage of the specific situation where
	both sides of the join use the same name for the joining column(s). It takes a comma-separated
	list of the shared column names and forms a join condition that includes an equality comparison
	for each one. For example, joining T1 and T2 with USING (a, b) produces the join condition
	ON T1.a = T2.a AND T1.b = T2.b.
