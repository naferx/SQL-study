-- counts all records. Good practice to use alias
SELECT

-- counts all records, similar to COUNT(*)
SELECT
	COUNT(1) AS total

	customers;


-- counts rows only where country is not null
SELECT
	COUNT(country)
FROM
	customers;



/*
	Counts only the different countries

	Checking the different 

	SELECT

SELECT

-- filtering out rows with WHERE clause
SELECT
	COUNT(country) AS total_brazil1
FROM
	customers
WHERE 
	country = 'Brazil';


SELECT
	COUNT(country) AS total_brazil2
FROM
	customers
WHERE 
	LOWER(country) = 'brazil';


-- using CASE to filter rows. Similar to the previous example
SELECT 
	COUNT(
		CASE WHEN country = 'Brazil' THEN 1 END
	) AS total_brazil3
FROM
	customers;

-- aggregate function per group
SELECT 
	country,
	COUNT(*) AS total_per_country
FROM 
	customers
GROUP BY 
	country;
/*
"country"	"total_per_country"
  null 	      1
  "Colombia"	1
  "Brazil"	  2
*/

-- Excluding nulls in the partitioning column
SELECT 
	country,
	COUNT(*) AS total_per_country
FROM 
	customers
WHERE 
	country IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
	country;
/*
"country"	"total_per_country"
  "Colombia"	1
  "Brazil"	  2
*/

-- ordering the results using an aggregate result
SELECT 
	country,
	COUNT(*) AS total_per_country
FROM 
	customers
WHERE 
	country IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
	country
ORDER BY 
	total_per_country DESC;
/*
"country"	"total_per_country"
  "Brazil"	  2  
  "Colombia"	1
*/
